			Principles Simplicity Arch Linux defines simplicity as without unnecessary
			additions or modifications. It ships software as released by the original
			developers (upstream) with minimal distribution-specific (downstream)
			changes: patches not accepted by upstream are avoided, and Arch's
			downstream patches consist almost entirely of backported bug fixes that
			are obsoleted by the project's next release. In a similar fashion, Arch
			ships the configuration files provided by upstream with changes limited to
			distribution-specific issues like adjusting the system file paths. It does
			not add automation features such as enabling a service simply because the
			package was installed. Packages are only split when compelling advantages
			exist, such as to save disk space in particularly bad cases of waste. GUI
			configuration utilities are not officially provided, encouraging users to
			perform most system configuration from the shell and a text editor.
			Modernity Arch Linux strives to maintain the latest stable release
			versions of its software as long as systemic package breakage can be
			reasonably avoided. It is based on a rolling-release system, which allows
			a one-time installation with continuous upgrades. Arch incorporates many
			of the newer features available to GNU/Linux users, including the systemd
			init system, modern file systems, LVM2, software RAID, udev support and
			initcpio (with mkinitcpio), as well as the latest available kernels.
			Pragmatism Arch is a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological
			one. The principles here are only useful guidelines. Ultimately, design
			decisions are made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus.
			Evidence-based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics
			or popular opinion. The large number of packages and build scripts in the
			various Arch Linux repositories offer free and open source software for
			those who prefer it, as well as proprietary software packages for those
			who embrace functionality over ideology. User centrality Whereas many
			GNU/Linux distributions attempt to be more user-friendly, Arch Linux has
			always been, and shall always remain user-centric. The distribution is
			intended to fill the needs of those contributing to it, rather than trying
			to appeal to as many users as possible. It is targeted at the proficient
			GNU/Linux user, or anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude who is willing to
			read the documentation, and solve their own problems. All users are
			encouraged to participate and contribute to the distribution. Reporting
			and helping fix bugs is highly valued and patches improving packages or
			the core projects are very appreciated: Arch's developers are volunteers
			and active contributors will often find themselves becoming part of that
			team. Archers can freely contribute packages to the Arch User Repository,
			improve the ArchWiki documentation, provide technical assistance to others
			or just exchange opinions in the forums, mailing lists, or IRC channels.
			Arch Linux is the operating system of choice for many people around the
			globe, and there exist several international communities that offer help
			and provide documentation in many different languages. Versatility Arch
			Linux is a general-purpose distribution. Upon installation, only a
			command-line environment is provided; rather than tearing out unneeded and
			unwanted packages, the user is offered the ability to build a custom
			system by choosing among thousands of high-quality packages provided in
			the official repositories for the x86-64 architecture. Arch is a
			rolling-release model backed by pacman, a lightweight, simple and fast
			package manager that allows for continuously upgrading the entire system
			with one command. Arch also provides the Arch Build System, a ports-like
			system to make it easy to build and install packages from source, which
			can also be synchronized with one command. In addition, the Arch User
			Repository contains many thousands of community-contributed PKGBUILD
			scripts for compiling installable packages from source using the makepkg
			application. It is also possible for users to build and maintain their own
			custom repositories with ease. History The Arch community has grown and
			matured to become one of the most popular and influential Linux
			distributions, also testified by the attention and review received over
			the years. Arch developers remain unpaid, part-time volunteers, and there
			are no prospects for monetizing Arch Linux, so it will remain free in all
			senses of the word. Those curious to peruse more detail about Arch's
			development history can browse the Arch entry in the Internet Archive
			Wayback Machine and the Arch Linux News Archives. The early years Judd
			Vinet, a Canadian programmer and occasional guitarist, began developing
			Arch Linux in early 2001. Its first formal release, Arch Linux 0.1, was on
			March 11, 2002. Inspired by the elegant simplicity of Slackware, BSD, PLD
			Linux and CRUX, and yet disappointed with their lack of package management
			at the time, Vinet built his own distribution on similar principles as
			those distros. But, he also wrote a package management program called
			pacman, to automatically handle package installation, removal, and
			upgrades. The middle years The early Arch community grew steadily, as
			evidenced by this chart of forum posts, users, and bug reports. Moreover,
			it was from its early days known as an open, friendly, and helpful
			community. Birth of the ArchWiki On 2005-07-08 the ArchWiki was first set
			up on the MediaWiki engine. The dawning of the age of A. Griffin In late
			2007, Judd Vinet retired from active participation as an Arch developer,
			and smoothly transferred the reins over to American programmer Aaron
			Griffin, also known as Phrakture. Arch Install Scripts The 2012-07-15
			release of the installation image deprecated the menu-driven Arch
			Installation Framework (AIF) in favor of the Arch Install Scripts
			(arch-install-scripts). The systemd era Between 2012 and 2013 the
			traditional System V init system was replaced by systemd.[1][2][3][4] Drop
			of i686 support On 2017-01-25 it was announced that support for the i686
			architecture would be phased out due to its decreasing popularity among
			the developers and the community. By the end of November 2017, all i686
			packages were removed from the mirrors. Review of Project Leader role and
			election At the start of 2020, in a team effort the Arch Linux staff
			devised a new process for determining future leaders, documented in
			DeveloperWiki:Project Leader. As Aaron Griffin had decided to step down
			from his role, a poll was held to elect a new person to replace him, and
			on 2020-02-24 its results were published, making the election of Levente
			Polyak official.
