			with Create React App. Available Scripts In the project directory, you can
			run: npm start Runs the app in the development mode. Open
			http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if
			you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console. npm test
			Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section
			about running tests for more information. npm run build Builds the app for
			production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production
			mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is
			minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be
			deployed! See the section about deployment for more information. npm run
			eject Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go
			back! If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration
			choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single
			build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the
			configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel,
			ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
			All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to
			the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your
			own. You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable
			for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use
			this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if
			you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it. Learn More You can
			learn more in the Create React App documentation. To learn React, check
			out the React documentation. About No description, website, or topics
